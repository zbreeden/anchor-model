# 🪝 Anchor Model  
_Modular Decision Model for Strategic Grounding and Reorientation_

The Anchor Model is the stabilizing node within the Orbiter–Anchor–Catalyst suite. Designed to restore strategic coherence after drift, overload, or dissonance, Anchor filters external signals, reasserts baselines, and guides reentry into aligned workflows. It enables cyclical recalibration without compromising foundational integrity.

Anchor is not static—it adapts to dynamic environments while preserving core principles. It listens, filters, and guides. It is the gravitational tether that allows Orbiter to drift and Catalyst to transform, without losing the thread.

## 🔧 Core Functions

- **Baseline Reassertion**  
  Reinforces strategic principles after drift or dissonance.

- **Signal Filtration**  
  Distills external inputs to isolate actionable insights.

- **Reorientation Protocols**  
  Guides reentry into aligned workflows, models, or decision paths.

## 🔄 Lifecycle Logic

Anchor operates in three adaptive phases:

1. **Signal Filtration**  
   Absorbs and filters external inputs to reduce noise.

2. **Baseline Reassertion**  
   Reinstates strategic clarity and foundational alignment.

3. **Reorientation Trigger**  
   Initiates recalibration and reentry into coherent models.

## 🧭 Suite Context

Anchor is part of a triple-system suite alongside:

- **Orbiter** – Models strategic detachment and drift monitoring  
- **Catalyst** – Drives transformation and signal amplification

Together, they simulate cyclical engagement, recalibration, and strategic evolution across dynamic environments.
